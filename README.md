# Swift 30 Projects

This repo is created to implement 30 mini swift projects which are solely meant for self-study. Every project here will be implemented using Swift 5.2 and onwards. The idea, 30 Projects, is heavily inspired by [soapyigu](https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects). The projects are ongoing, so this repo is contemporary 😝.
